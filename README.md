# Raymarching-and-Raytracing
Work towards a multithreaded pathtracer and volume raymarcher.
Currently it supports triangulated meshes, implicit shapes, signed distance fields, volumes from triangulated meshes, color fields with a variety of gradients, point lights and ambient light, as well as transformations (scale, rotate, translate, shear) and transformation groups, and CSG operations.
